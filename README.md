# M3D Fio
OctoPrint plugin for the Micro 3D printer that provides a complete, platform independent alternative to the printer's official software .

You can install it with OctoPrint's built in plugin manager using the following URL as the plugins source.

```shell
https://github.com/donovan6000/M3D-Fio/archive/master.zip
```

M3D Fio works in conjunction with OctoPrint's autodetect serial port and baudrate feature, so neither of those values need to be specified in order to successfully connect to the Micro 3D printer.
