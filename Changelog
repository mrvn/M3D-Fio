Changelog:

V0.23 December 17, 2015

	* Implemented way to modify the printer profile, slicer profile, and model when slicing
	* Improved the on the fly pre-procesor so that it doesn't send so many G4 commands. Thanks mrvn!
	* Went through all the pre-processor stages and made sure they match the ones in the official software. The only stages that differ are preparation, thermal bonding and wave bonding since the official versions have errors or lacks functionality.
	* Added a Micro 3D printer profile that gets installed and selected automatically
	* Added ability to upload ans slice obj and m3d models

V0.22 December 1, 2015

	* Added a 'Complete bed compensation' button to make it simplier to calibrate the bed
	* Implemented on the fly G-code pre-processing which takes affect while printing. This removes the need to pre-process the G-code when uploaded/sliced, and OctoPrint's G-code viewer works when using this
	* Removed shared libraries in favor of on the fly G-code pre-processing
	* Made it so both the fan and temperature settings can be changed while printing

V0.21 November 28, 2015

	* Fixed a problem that would cause the fan to get turned off right before printing that could result in the extruder having difficulties in extruding hot filament.

V0.20 November 25, 2015

	* Added EEPROM management
	* Changed way that messages are shown so that they look more native to OctoPrint
	* Implemented the 'first run' stuff from the official software, so now M3D Fio is a complete replacement for the official software

V0.19 November 22, 2015

	* Fixed a problem where the printer couldn't reconnect after disconnecting
	* Fixed control tabs not looking/working correctly when using a web cam

V0.18 November 8, 2015

	* Added shared library for 32-bit Windows
	* Fixed using correct shared library when Python is being run as a different architecture that the device
	* Improved detecting port that printer is connected to

V0.17 October 27, 2015

	* Updated to match latest official firmware

V0.16 October 8, 2015

	* Fixed Raspberry PI detection
	* Improved filtering out invalid G-codes generated by Slic3r
	* Added ability to flash unencrypted firmware

V0.15 September 13, 2015

	* Added support for Synology. Thanks mrkb_.
	* Fixed issue where printing test border would stop. Thanks again mrkb_.
	* Added Linux 32-bit shared library
	* Added option to ignore printer's dimension limitations

V0.14 September 11, 2015

	* Fixed issue with compatibility with the newest OctoPrint

V0.13 August 27, 2015

	* Added shared library for Windows
	* Optimized shared libraries for Raspberry Pi 1 and 2
	* Automatically installs and updates Cura profiles

V0.12 August 25, 2015

	* Fixed ARM shared library to work on Raspberry Pi

V0.11 August 19, 2015

	* Utilizes shared libraries for 64bit Linux and ARM Linux devices to speed up the pre-processors significantly

V0.10 August 18, 2015

	* Added in new changes to the newest official M3D software.
	* Fixed an issue with using the wrong offset for obtaining the bed height offset.
	* Implemented invalid bed orientation detection.

V0.9 August 10, 2015

	* Improved G-code class by using regular expressions for parsing the input and by aligning array offsets with the command values. Thanks Fylnn.
	* Sped up centering model, thermal bonding, and wave bonding pre-processors.
	* Sped up checking print dimensions.

V0.8 August 2, 2015

	* Utilizes OctoPrint's native update feature.
	
V0.7 August 1, 2015

	* Initial release.
